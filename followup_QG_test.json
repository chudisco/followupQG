        "first_response": "Based on the information provided in the sources, it appears that there is evidence that Enron employees intentionally destroyed documents related to the company's financial activities. Several sources indicate that Enron employees were involved in shredding and deleting documents, even after the company had issued warnings against destroying evidence [1, 3, 6, 11, 13, 16, 22]. \n \n\n Specifically, former Enron employee Maureen Castaneda stated that she witnessed the mass shredding of financial documents at Enron's accounting office, which began around Thanksgiving and continued through at least the previous week [13, 16, 22]. Lawyer William Lerach also stated that the destruction of evidence at Enron was \"open and notorious and widespread\", and that employees even shredded documents on Christmas Day [6, 11].\n \n\n Additionally, the sources indicate that Enron's former auditor, Arthur Andersen, was also involved in the destruction of Enron-related documents [4, 5, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25]. The chairman of a Congressional subcommittee investigating Enron's collapse stated that scores of people who worked at Andersen's Houston office were involved in the destruction of Enron documents [17].\n \n\n Therefore, based on the evidence presented in the sources, it appears that Enron employees, as well as employees of Enron's auditor Arthur Andersen, did intentionally destroy documents related to Enron's financial activities [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25].",

        "first_response": "Based on the information provided, the sources present a mixed view on whether Enron was a happy place to work. Some sources suggest that Enron was a great place to work and enabled many employees to fulfill their potential [10, 19, 20]. However, other sources indicate that Enron was a \"cutthroat\" and \"stab you in the back organization\" where only some employees became rich while others \"simply vanished\" [12, 16]. Additionally, one source notes that \"people may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy\" [1]. Overall, the sources do not provide a clear consensus on whether Enron was a happy workplace.",
